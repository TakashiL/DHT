# DHT
## Introduction
This project is the implementatino for DHT(Distributed Hash Table), which ios a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table. There are (key, value) pairs. Given the key, the value associated can be retrieved efficiently.

## Algorithm
* This project uses **Union Find Set** algorithm to get result.

## Input & Output
* The input must be `DHT.in` and the output must be `DHTout.out`.


## Compile and Run
You can use the following script to compile and execute

```shell
gcc main.c -o dht
./dht
```
